        <br>
        <h2>The offence has the possesion of the ball.

            They start on first down. they have 4 tries to get the ball 10 yards. 
            <br>
            On 4th down, if the team doesn't get the first down, they will usually kick a field goal if they are in range or punt the ball, however the team can choose to keep their offence on the field and try for the first to keep possesion. 
            <br>
            However if they don't get the yards needed the ball is given to the other teams offence where the 4th down ball is marked.
